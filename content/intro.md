### Introduction to ROADS: the Algorithms, Data Structures, and Foundations of Machine Learning Group at IISc Bangalore

The ROADS group, or the group for Research on Algorithms and Data Structures, has a focus on solving problems at the
cutting edge of Theoretical CS and Foundations of Machine Learning. Our group at the Indian Institute of Science
Bangalore is dedicated to advancing the field of computer science through rigorous research. The group's forte is on the
development and analysis of algorithms, with researchers who wield a variety of theoretical tools.
Our group has a breadth across a variety of areas including computational geometry, foundations of machine learning,
online learning and optimization.

### Research Focus

Our research primarily encompasses the following aspects:

- **Algorithmic Research**: Our primary research involves the theoretical and empirical study of algorithms. This
  includes the development of new algorithms, analysis of existing ones, and optimization for enhanced performance.
- **Data Structures**: We investigate advanced data structures for efficient data management and retrieval, focusing on
  scalability and robustness in the face of large and complex datasets.
- **Foundations of Machine Learning**: The group also explores the foundational aspects of machine learning algorithms.
  This includes both theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations in their implementation and application.
- **Collaboration and Academic Pursuits**: Our research group values collaboration with academic and industry partners,
  believing that interdisciplinary efforts are key to innovation. We are committed to contributing to the academic
  community through publications, conferences, and seminars.
- **Educational Role**: As part of IISc Bangalore, our group plays an integral role in educating future computer
  scientists. We provide mentorship and instruction, emphasizing the development of both theoretical understanding and
  practical skills.

The ROADS group at IISc Bangalore is committed to contributing to the body of knowledge in computer science, promoting
innovation, and fostering the next generation of researchers and practitioners in the field.
