<b>Abstract:</b>
Consider a set $P \subseteq \Re^d$ of n points, and a convex body $C$ provided via a separation oracle. The task at hand is to decide for each point of $P$ if it is in $C$ using the fewest number of oracle queries. We show that one can solve this problem in two and three dimensions using $O( h(P) \log n)$ queries, where $h(P)$ is the largest subset of points of P in convex position. Furthermore, we show that in two dimensions one can solve this problem using $O( v(P,C) \log^2 n )$ oracle queries, where $v(P, C)$ is a lower bound on the minimum number of queries that any algorithm for this specific instance requires.
