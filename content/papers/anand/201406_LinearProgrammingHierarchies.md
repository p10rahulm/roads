<b>Abstract:</b>
We demonstrate that l rounds of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy and 2l rounds of the Lovasz-Schrijver hierarchy suffice to reduce the integrality gap of a natural LP relaxation for Directed Steiner Tree in l-layered graphs from \(\Omega(\sqrt k)\) to O(l·logk) where k is the number of terminals. This is an improvement over Rothvoss’ result that 2l rounds of the considerably stronger Lasserre SDP hierarchy reduce the integrality gap of a similar formulation to O(l·logk).
