<b>Abstract:</b>
Graph coloring problems are a central topic of study in the theory of algorithms. We study the problem of partially coloring partially colorable graphs. For \alpha \leq 1 and k \in \mathbb{Z}^+, we say that a graph G=(V,E) is \alpha-partially k-colorable, if there exists a subset S\subset V of cardinality |S | \geq \alpha | V | such that the graph induced on S is k-colorable. Partial k-colorability is a more robust structural property of a graph than k-colorability. For graphs that arise in practice, partial k-colorability might be a better notion to use than k-colorability, since data arising in practice often contains various forms of noise. 
We give a polynomial time algorithm that takes as input a (1 - \epsilon)-partially 3-colorable graph G and a constant \gamma \in [\epsilon, 1/10], and colors a (1 - \epsilon/\gamma) fraction of the vertices using \tilde{O}\left(n^{0.25 + O(\gamma^{1/2})} \right) colors. We also study natural semi-random families of instances of partially 3-colorable graphs and partially 2-colorable graphs, and give stronger bi-criteria approximation guarantees for these family of instances.
