<b>Abstract:</b>
We consider the Degree-Bounded Survivable Network Design Problem: the objective is to find a minimum cost subgraph satisfying the given connectivity requirements as well as the degree bounds on the vertices. If we denote the upper bound on the degree of a vertex v by b(v), then we present an algorithm that finds a solution whose cost is at most twice the cost of the optimal solution while the degree of a degree constrained vertex v is at most 2b(v) + 2. This improves upon the results of Lau and Singh and that of Lau, Naor, Salavatipour and Singh.
